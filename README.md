👋 Hey, I'm an undergraduate majoring software engineering. Previously worked as intern in ByteDance, Alibaba Cloud, and Jump Trading. My interests include networking, system programming and so on.

🏆 [Got a 🥇 and a 🥉 in ACM/ICPC](https://icpc.global/ICPCID/6TMTTSRK8SRZ).


Some of my work:
- [catproc](https://github.com/rapiz1/catp/): a tool to inspect the output of a running process.
- [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole): a reverse proxy for NAT traversal.
- [GSoC 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6016402642698240/): I developed several container libraries for [the Chapel programming language](https://chapel-lang.org/).
- [DungeonRush](https://github.com/rapiz1/dungeonrush): a fun game made when I was a freshman.
