My open-source work was mainly done when I was a student. Now I'm an SDE in an HFT firm, so not sure how much leisure I have now to follow up on all the things. Sorry for that!

Some of my work:
- [catproc](https://github.com/rapiz1/catp/): a tool to inspect the output of a running process.
- [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole): a reverse proxy for NAT traversal.
- [GSoC 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6016402642698240/): I developed several container libraries for [the Chapel programming language](https://chapel-lang.org/).
- [DungeonRush](https://github.com/rapiz1/dungeonrush): a game in pure C.
